# 🖥️ System Monitor Dashboard

A **full-stack web application** built using **React (frontend)** and **Node.js + Express (backend)** that displays real-time system statistics — such as **CPU load**, **memory usage**, and **disk usage** — in a clean and interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project helps monitor system performance visually in real time.  
The backend collects live hardware information using the [`systeminformation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systeminformation) package,  
while the frontend fetches and displays it dynamically.
